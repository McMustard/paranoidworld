This is Paranoid World, a game inspired by PARANOIA and Dungeon World, but is
not a part of either game system. In a way, this is like PARANOIA fan-fiction,
just in a game form rather than prose. Paranoid World makes reference to
fictional characters, groups, and phenomena described in PARANOIA. Paranoid
World uses mechanics derived heavily from Dungeon World.

PARANOIA is a trademark of Eric Goldberg and Greg Costikyan, and is published
by Mongoose Publishing Ltd.

Dungeon World is published by The Burning Wheel.

Paranoid World introduces the following NON-trademarks:
    * FeltGrip
    * Press-O-Matic
The use of the Trademark â„¢ ("TM") symbol is comical, and any resemblance to
real trademarks is not intended and is coincidental if it occurs.
